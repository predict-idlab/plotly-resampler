    """Largest Triangle Three Buckets (LTTB) aggregation method.

    This is arguably the most widely used aggregation method. It is based on the
    effective area of a triangle (inspired from the line simplification domain).
    The algorithm has $O(n)$ complexity, however, for large datasets, it can be much
    slower than other algorithms (e.g. MinMax) due to the higher cost of calculating
    the areas of triangles.

    .. Tip::
        `LTTB` doesn't scale super-well when moving to really large datasets, so when
        dealing with more than 1 million samples, you might consider using
        :class:`MinMaxLTTB <MinMaxLTTB>`.


    Note
    ----
    * This class is mainly designed to operate on numerical data as LTTB calculates
      distances on the values. |br|
      When dealing with categories, the data is encoded into its numeric codes,
      these codes are the indices of the category array.
    * To aggregate category data with LTTB, your ``pd.Series`` must be of dtype
      'category'. |br|
      **Tip**: if there is an order in your categories, order them that way, LTTB uses
      the ordered category codes values (see bullet above) to calculate distances and
      make aggregation decisions.
      .. code::
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> s = pd.Series(["a", "b", "c", "a"])
        >>> cat_type = pd.CategoricalDtype(categories=["b", "c", "a"], ordered=True)
        >>> s_cat = s.astype(cat_type)
    * `LTTB` has no downsample kwargs, as it cannot be paralellized. Instead, you can
      use the :class:`MinMaxLTTB <MinMaxLTTB>` downsampler, which performs
      minmax preselection (in parallel if configured so), followed by LTTB.
