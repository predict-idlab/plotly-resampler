# Latest

# v0.10.1
## What's Changed
After resampling the figure, the line goes beyond figure frontier indicating presence of data. https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler/pull/308

# v0.10.0
## New Features
üö®  `Nan` handling has been delegated to the `aggregators`, this implies that `plotly-resampler` does not perform any nan-checks anymore (making it faster) üêé.

Consequently, we removed the `check_nans` argument of the FigureResampler constructor and its `add_traces` method. This argument was used to check for NaNs in the input data, but this is now handled by the `nan_policy` argument of specific aggregators (see for instance the constructor of the `MinMax` and `MinMaxLTTB` aggregator). üîç

### üí® remove [traceUpdater](https://github.com/predict-idlab/trace-updater) dash component as a dependency.
> **context**: see #281 #271 
> `traceUpdater` was developed during a period when Dash did not yet contain the [Patch ](https://dash.plotly.com/partial-properties)feature for partial property updates. As such, `traceUpdater` has become somewhat redundant is now effectively replaced with Patch.

üö® This is a breaking change with previous `Dash` apps!!!

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2


# v0.9.1
## Major changes:
Support for multiple axes. 

The `.GIF` below demonstrates how multiple axes on a subplots can be used to enhance the number of visible traces, without using more (vertical) screen space üî•!

Make sure to take a look at our [examples](https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler/blob/main/examples/other_examples.ipynb)

![Peek 2023-07-13 10-24](https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler/assets/38005924/aa5d278f-7baf-4251-91b5-7445eb7d53d0)

## What's Changed (generated)
* :fire: multiple y-axes support by @jonasvdd in https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler/pull/244
 

 # v0.9.0
## Major changes:
### Even faster aggregation üêé
We switched our aggregation backend to [tsdownsample](https://github.com/predict-idlab/tsdownsample), which alleviates the need to compile our C code on non-supported devices, and has parallelization capabilities. 
`tsdownsample` leverages the [argminmax](https://github.com/jvdd/argminmax) crate, which has SIMD-optimized instruction to find vertical extrema really fast! 

With parallelization enabled, you should clearly see a bump in perfomance when visualizing (multiple) large traces! üêé

### Versioned docs! :party:
We restyled our [documentation](https://predict-idlab.github.io/plotly-resampler/latest) and added versioning! üéâ

https://predict-idlab.github.io/plotly-resampler/latest/

Go check it out! :point_up:

### Other Features
- Support for **log-scale** axes (and thus log-bin-based aggregators) - check [this pull-request](https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler/pull/207)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/372491075153166338/1129004610472906782/image.png)

> The above image shows how the `log` aggregator (row2) will use log-scale bins. This can be seen in the 1-1000 range when comparing both subplots. <br>*Note: the shown data has a fixed delta-x of 1. Hence, here are no exact equally spaced bins for the left part of the LogLTTB.*

- Add a fill-value option to gap handlers
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/372491075153166338/1129004638016897045/image.png)

> The above image shows how the `fill_value` option can be used to fill gaps with a specific value.<br> This can be of greate use, when you use the `fill='tozeroy'` option in plotly **and gaps occur in your data**, as this will, combined with `line_shape='vh'`, fill the area between the trace and the x-axis and gaps will be a flat zero-line.
### Bugfixes
- support for pandas2.0 intricacies

# v 0.8.0

## Major changes

### Faster aggregation üêé 
the `lttbc` dependency is removed; and we added our own (faster) lttb C implementation. Additionally we provide a Python fallback when this lttb-C building fails. In the near future, we will look into CIBuildWheels to build the wheels for the major OS & Python matrix versions.  
A well deserved s/o to [dgoeris/lttbc](https://github.com/dgoeries/lttbc), who heavily inspired our implementation!

### Figure Output serialization üì∏ 
Plotly-resampler now also has the option to store the output figure as an Image in notebook output. As long the notebook is connected, the interactive plotly-resampler figure is shown; but once the figure / notebook isn't connected anymore, a static image will be rendered in the notebook output.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0

# V0.7.0

## What's Changed

**You can register plotly_resampler**; this adds dynamic resampling functionality *under the hood* to plotly.py! ü•≥
As a result, you can stop wrapping plotly figures with a plotly-resampler decorator (as this all happens automatically) 
> You only need to call the `register_plotly_resampler` method and all plotly figures will be wrapped (under the hood) according to that method's configuration.

-> More info in the [README](https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler#usage) and [docs](https://predict-idlab.github.io/plotly-resampler/getting_started.html#how-to-use)!

Aditionally, all resampler Figures are now composable; implying that they can be decorated by themselves and all other types of plotly-(resampler) figures. This eases the switching from a FigureResampler to FigureWidgetResampler and vice-versa.
