# plotly-resampler examples

This directory withholds several examples, highlighting the applicability of plotly-resampler for various use cases.


## Prerequisites

To successfully run these examples, make sure that you've installed all the [requirements](requirements.txt) by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 1. Example notebooks
### 1.1 basic examples

The [basic example notebook](basic_example.ipynb) covers most use-cases in which plotly-resampler will be employed. It serves as an ideal starting point for data-scientists who want to use plotly-resampler in their day-to-day jupyter environments.

Additionally, this notebook also shows some more advanced functionalities, such as:
* Retaining (a static) plotly-resampler figure in your notebook
* Showing how to style the marker color and size of plotly-resampler figures
* Adjusting trace data of plotly-resampler figures at runtime
* How to add (shaded) confidence bounds to your time series
* The flexibility of configuring different aggregation-algorithms and number of shown samples per trace
* How plotly-resampler can be used for logarithmic x-axes and an implementation of a logarithmic aggregation algorithm, i.e., [LogLTTB](example_utils/loglttb.py)
* Using different `fill_value` for gap handling of filled area plots.

**Note**: the basic example notebook requires `plotly-resampler>=0.9.0rc3`.

### 1.2 Figurewidget example

The [figurewidget example notebook](figurewidget_example.ipynb) utilizes the `FigureWidgetResampler` wrapper to create a `go.FigureWidget` with dynamic aggregation functionality. A major advantage of this approach is that this does not create a web application, avoiding starting an application on a port (and forwarding that port when working remotely).

Additionally, this notebook highlights how to use the `FigureWidget` its on-click callback to utilize plotly for large **time series annotation**.

## 2. Dash apps

The [dash_apps](dash_apps/) folder contains example dash apps in which `plotly-resampler` is integrated

| [server side caching](dash_apps/02_minimal_cache.py) | *good practice*: minimal example in which we perform server side caching of the `FigureResampler` variable                                                                                                                                                                          |

Graph interaction events on the coarse graph update the dynamic graph. |
